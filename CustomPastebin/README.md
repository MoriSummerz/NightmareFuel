# Custom Pastebin
this is a basic Next.js app that [@evolutionleo](https://github.com/evolutionleo) hosted on his website evoleo.dev to work around not having proper copy/paste functionality between the virtual and local machines
the app pulls new texts from the API every 200ms, so that you don't have to reload the page at all

## Installing deps:
- Run `npm i`

## Running:
- Run `npm run dev`
- Navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
